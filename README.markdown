RoboTamer the multi-paradigm php programming framework
======================================================

Object-oriented programming in PHP has become the thing to do recently.
I too have bought in to it, and have been educating my self about OOP.

OOP is okay, specially if you are working in a team, however I believe that there are advantages to procedural programming, specially for smaller projects. OOP is just so inefficacy versus the procedural paradigm.

With RoboTamer I am trying to create a platform, where we can take advantage of both programming paradigms as needed.

My outcome is to create something that 

 * minimally effects your programming style 
 * is easily adoptable
 * easy to learn
 * can fit within other frameworks, and scripts like worldpress
 
Basically , it's more like a set of helpers rather then a framework, but who knows what it will turn in to.

 
Stay tuned, more to come soon!
