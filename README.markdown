RoboTamer the multi-paradigm php programming framework
======================================================

Object-oriented programming in PHP has become the thing to do recently.
I too have bought in to it, and have been adjucating my self about OO.

OO definatly has his place, specialy if you are working in a team, however I believe that the is advantages procedural programming. It has is place specialy for smaller projects.

With RoboTamer I am trying to create a platform, where we can take advantage of both programming paradigms.
My outcome is to create something that 
 * minimaly effects your programming style 
 * is easily adoptable
 * easy to learn
 * can fit within other frameworks, and scripts like worldpress
 
Basiclly , it's more like a set of helpers rather then a framework.

 
Stay tuned, more to come!
